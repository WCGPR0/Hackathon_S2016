Hardware Hackathon Spring 2016

The primary objective of this hackathon is to construct a device which meets as many of the following criteria in the most complex and interesting way possible:
The device is able to manipulate itself or its environment in some way.
The device is able to autonomously respond to changes in its environment. 
The device is able to receive remote input from a person in a way different from the second bullet.

This type of device includes most ‘smart’ products on the market today such as lights, thermostats, smoke alarms, vacuums, coffee makers, etc.  Additionally, this could include any number of autonomous/RC controlled quad copters, planes, cars, submarines, boats, etc.  The key here is to build something which can function in some way on its own by responding to its environment in some way, but is also configurable using some sort of remote mechanism.  Be creative, there are all sorts of possibilities!
